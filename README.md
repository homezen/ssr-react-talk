# React Static/Server-Side Rendering (S/SSR) Talk

This talk uses Spectacle -  [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

## Running examples

Some of the examples have npm scripts to make them easy to run. (Remember to clone and run `npm i` first)

-   `npm run demo-static-basic`
-   `npm run demo-univ-basic`

## Development

Clone and run `npm i`

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
